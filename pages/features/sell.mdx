# Sell NFT

Once your items are listed on OpenZoo, they can be instantly purchased and resold by any users of the platform. OpenZoo allows the sale of NFT creations in a secure user-friendly environment at practically no cost.

You can also set several options for your NFT such as **price, availability for auction, reserve price,** etc…
Another option that can be activated when creating an NFT is **“Royalties"**. Royalties are an automated merchant trade agreement which provides a way to recoup a percentage of resales for that specific NFT on secondary market sales.

Users can use **$ZOO tokens** to trade on OpenZoo.
