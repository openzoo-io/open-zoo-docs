# Purchase NFT

Users are able to browse other userâ€™s NFT Collections through a decentralized NFT Explorer and purchase their very own unique collectibles. 

Buyers can acquire their selected NFT directly, or make offers to the seller. While the seller can easily accept the offer, the buyer can choose to withdraw it, all within the selected time limit.
Alternatively, a bid can be submitted if the NFT chosen is available for auction. Once a bid is submitted, the seller has the choice to accept it as a final price or to let the auction end at the originally selected date/time.

Price history, previous listings and current offers are all available details displayed on the selected NFT page.
