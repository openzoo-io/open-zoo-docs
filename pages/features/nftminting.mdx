# NFT Minting

The NFT Creator function is essential to every participating artist on OpenZoo. 

Boasting immense ease of use, it combines:

*   mandatory content - name, description, symbol, image and selection of a collection;
*   some optional extras - set Royalties or Unlockable Content.

Note that when creating with a multi tokens (WRC-1155) collection selected, users will have to also enter the desired **supply** of NFTs.

It is very important to make sure all these details are correct before the actual minting as the process can not be undone.

The “Delete” action can be used for emergencies but will simply unlist the NFT from OpenZoo.
