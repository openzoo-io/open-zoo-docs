# Getting Started

Users are free to use the explorer and browse NFT listings, but in order to begin the creation process a wallet must be connected.

OpenZoo only supports **Metamask** wallet.

Before you start, make sure you have downloaded Metamask and connected it to the Wanchain network. For more info on how to proceed, check the following guide: [Connect Metamask to Wanchain Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8Od0j0ta2A)

Once you are connected, you can start creating on OpenZoo.
