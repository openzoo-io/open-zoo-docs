# Report

Because NFTs can’t be copied or altered, they are especially suited for tracking ownership of property that can’t be replicated.
Please always report **fraudulent artworks.** 

Press the “Report” button located on the NFT product pages, fill in the information as requested and the OpenZoo admin will be notified of the potential copyright abuse.

All collections, verified or not, are **subject to ban from the platform** if multiple legitimate reports are received from other users.
