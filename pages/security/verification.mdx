Obtaining the **official OpenZoo verification badge** for one's collection is of prime importance to boost recognition and exposure amongst the community. As by default settings, only collections displaying the official OpenZoo verification badge will be showing in the Explore tab.

Prior to being granted the verification badge, creators must mint their NFT collections. These need to include **creative content** and the owner must have **rights of publication and sale** of the NFT. 

Once done, contact OpenZoo team for examination via Telegram or Discord at the following:
